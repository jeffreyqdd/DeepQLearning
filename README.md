# Deep Q Learning

I've done multiple attempts in the past. However, this is my genuine attempt at
learning and "mastering deep Q learning"

# setup:
1. ```cd $(python -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print(get_python_lib())")```
2. ```echo /some/library/path > some-library.pth```
